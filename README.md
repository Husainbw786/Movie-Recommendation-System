# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using Python. The recommendation system suggests similar movies based on their tags, such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

## About

The Movie Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences. By analyzing the tags associated with each movie, including genres, keywords, cast, and crew, the system identifies similar movies and presents them as recommendations.

The project utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation, Numpy for numerical computations, scikit-learn for text vectorization and cosine similarity calculation, and NLTK for natural language processing.

## Usage

1. Place the movie dataset files (`credits.csv` and `movies.csv`) in the project directory.

2. Open the Python script and run it using any Python IDE or command line.

3. The script will load the dataset, perform data preprocessing, and build a movie recommendation model.

4. Once the model is built, you can call the `recommend(movie)` function and provide the name of a movie as an argument to get the top 5 recommended movies similar to it.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** The project performs several data preprocessing steps on the movie dataset, including cleaning the data, extracting relevant information, converting columns into appropriate formats, and creating a consolidated "tags" column.

- **Movie Recommendation:** The recommendation system is based on cosine similarity between movie tags. It vectorizes the movie tags, calculates the cosine similarity between movies, and retrieves the top 5 movies similar to the input movie.

- **Personalized Recommendations:** The recommendation system takes into account user preferences based on the tags associated with movies. By analyzing the genres, keywords, cast, and crew, it suggests movies that are likely to align with the user's interests.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main Python script that implements the movie recommendation system.
- `credits.csv`: CSV file containing information about movie credits.
- `movies.csv`: CSV file containing information about movies.
- `README.md`: The readme file that provides an overview of the project.
